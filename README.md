### RDA-landscape-genetics
-------------------

This repository provides code and explanation associated with a review of the different applications of RDA in the field of landscape genomics written by Thibaut Capblancq & Brenna Forester (2021). Redundancy Analysis (RDA): a Swiss-army knife for landscape genomics. (DOI: XX)

1. *"ClimateNA_formatting.R"* is a script used to re-project Climate NA bioclimate rasters into WGS84 coordinate system

2. *"RDA_landscape_genomics.html"* is a tutorial of the various RDA-based approaches reviewed

3. *"RDA_landscape_genomics.Rmd"* is the Rmd script used to produce the html tutorial and which can be used to find the raw code used to produce all the results of the study

4. The *"src"* directory contains various functions used in the script RDA_landscape_genomics.R
